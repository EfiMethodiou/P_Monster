# P_Monster
The P monster. Aka the procrastination monster. A CSS drawing project.

P is the little monster that hides inside our heads and distracts our focus by throwing different ideas in our head and makes us do different things. All with a goal to make us non productive. 

PS: This is the first version of this project. In the next version there will be many changes to the responsiveness of the page, the dialog and others.
